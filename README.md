Learning how to use GitHub
Hi everybody!
My name is Mihkel and I am new to programming. I find programming and development very interesting and have taken up learning Python as a hobby. I'm 28 years old right now so I still have a good amount of time on my hands to get better! Hope to someday be able to read this readme again while also understanding how to code.

Good luck to me I suppose.
